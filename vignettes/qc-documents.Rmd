This vignette provides detailed documentation and usage examples for generating QC summary documents with the the `qctools` package. The functions, `renderQCSummary()` and `renderQCReport()`, generate documents containing QC summary tables. These are intended to aid in quality control and prioritizing QC resourcing.

## Table of Contents

-   **`renderQCSummary()`**: Generates a document with summary tables of outstanding QC information
-   **`renderQCReport()`**: Generates a document that provides the QC status of files on a project

---

## `renderQCSummary()`

The `renderQCSummary()` generates a QC summary based on scripts within a given project and renders it into a PDF report. This
PDF contains multiple summaries, including:

- files with outstanding QC that have been added to the `QClog.csv` file
- recently modified files that have not been added to the `QClog.csv` file

### Usage

```r
renderQCSummary()
```

#### Outstanding QC Summary

**Output:**

| file                   | status              | last author     | Previous QCers           |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| script/data-assembly.R | Assigned - needs QC | Jane Doe        | none                     |
| script/examp-txt.txt   | Modified - needs QC | John Smith      | Alice Johnson            |
| script/pk/load-spec.R  | Modified - needs QC | John Smith      | Jane Doe, Alice Johnson  |

Each file that appears in this table requires QC. The status `Assigned - needs QC` indicates that the file has never been
previous QC'd. `Modified - needs QC` indicates that the file has been QC'd, but has since been updated. A list of previous
QCers is included for these files.

#### Recently Modified Files Summary

**Output:**

| file                     | last author   | Days since last edit     |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| script/eda-tables.R      | Jane Doe      | 1                        |
| script/eda-figures.R     | Alice Johnson | 8                        |
| script/pk/check-sum.yaml | Alice Johnson | 20                       |

This summary is intended to identify files that have been recently modified (within the last 20 days) but have not been assigned in the `QClog.csv` file.

## `renderQCReport()`

The `renderQCReport()` generates a QC status summary of all files in the `QClog.csv` file and renders it into a PDF report.

### Usage

```r
renderQCReport()
```

**Output:**

![Output of `renderQCReport()`: The project name and date/time the report was generated is shown above the summary table. The table shows the QC status of all files in the `QClog.csv` file. If a file is up to date with QC, the date and commit hash of when the QC was completed is shown.](figures/qc-report.png){width=700}

# Additional Notes

- **Saving documents**: Users can save either QC document to a specific directory using the `.output_dir` parameter.
