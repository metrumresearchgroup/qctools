This vignette provides detailed documentation and usage examples for the compare functions in the `qctools` package: `compareFigures()` and `compareTables()`. These functions facilitate a visual comparison of different versions of 
outputs (e.g. figures and tables).

## Table of Contents

-   Use cases:
    - Comparing versions of the same file
    - Comparing two different files
-   **`compareFigures()`**: Generates a document showing two versions of a list of figures (pdf or png).
-   **`compareTables()`**: Generates a document showing two versions of a list of tables (tex).

---

## Use cases

`compareFigures()` and `compareTables()` can generate two types of comparisons.

-   Comparisons of two versions of the same file (leveraging version control)
-   Comparisons of two different files

Both functions have a `.path_previous` argument. If left empty, a document will be generated comparing the
current version of the figure/table to the most recent version. If the user provides a file path to the 
`.path_previous` argument, then the document will show a comparison of the two figures/tables.

Additionally, users can generate these comparisons on either a single file or a directory of files. If a directory is 
given, the document will contain all relevant figures/tables in that directory.

### Setup

For the sections below, the following project structure is used. Figures are stored in `deliv/figure` and tables
are stored in `deliv/table`.

```
project/
│
├── deliv/
│   ├── figure/
|       ├── example-pdf1.pdf
|       ├── example-pdf2.pdf
|       ├── example-pdf3.pdf
|       └── example-png1.png
│   ├── table/
│       ├── example-table-1.tex
│       └── example-table-long-1.tex
```

## `compareFigures()`

The `compareFigures()` function generates a html page with a visual comparison between two versions of a file. If a 
directory is provided, all version controlled figures will be included in the html page.

### Usage

#### Compare versions of a single file

```r
compareFigures(.path_current = "deliv/figure/example-pdf1.pdf")
```

**Output:**

![Output of `compareFigures()`: Left box shows the version of the file currently checked into the repository. Right box shows version of the figure on disk.](figures/compare-fig-git.png){width=700}

#### Compare two local figures

```r
compareFigures(
  .path_current = "deliv/figure/example-pdf3.pdf",
  .path_previous = "deliv/figure/example-pdf2.pdf"
)
```

**Output:**

![Output of `compareFigures()`: Left box shows the current version of `deliv/figure/example-pdf2.pdf`. Right box shows the current version of `deliv/figure/example-pdf3.pdf`. When multi-page figures are being compared, users are able to scroll through all pages in the pdf.](figures/compare-fig-local.png){width=700}

---

## `compareTables()`

The `compareTables()` function generates a html page with a visual comparison between two versions of a table. If a 
directory is provided, all version controlled tables will be included in the html page.

### Usage

#### Compare versions of a single table

```r
compareTables(.path_current = "deliv/table/example-table-1.tex")
```

**Output:**

![Output of `compareTables()`: Left box shows the version of the file currently checked into the repository. Right box shows version of the table on disk.](figures/compare-table-git.png){width=700}

#### Compare two local tables

Similar to `compareFigures()`, users can compare two different tables with the following code:

```r
compareTables(
  .path_current = "deliv/table/example-table-1.tex",
  .path_previous = "example-table-long-1.tex"
)
```

# Additional Notes

- **Customization**: Users can customize the display of comparison by adjusting the `.side_by_side` parameter as needed.
